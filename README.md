# VIMz <> STARKs
## Enabling Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Media Provenance on STARKNET
> [!NOTE]
> This Repo will later be merged into the [VIMz](https://github.com/zero-savvy/vimz)
## Overview:
We have been working on the VIMz framework for more than a year now. We formally prove the security of VIMz on our recent paper. This follow-up to the VIMz seeks to extend its capabilities by transitioning from folding-based zkSNARKs to STARK-based proofs, enabling compatibility with the Starknet ecosystem. The core goal of this project is to leverage Cairo to generate proofs of verifiable image manipulations (VIMz). By integrating VIMz into Starknet, we aim to bring practical media provenance into the ecosystem, where developers will be able to build authentic media marketplaces that are compatible with C2PA standards.
## Key Objectives:
 - STARK-based Proof Generation:
   - Replace the existing folding-based zkSNARK system with STARKs.
   - Implement image transformation verification in Cairo.
 - Cairo Smart Contract Development:
   - Design and deploy smart contracts written in Cairo that verify STARK proofs of image authenticity and transformation correctness.
   - Ensure that the smart contracts maintain the same privacy-preserving properties of VIMz, protecting the identities of creators and editors while proving the authenticity of the final image.
 - Removal of Folding Schemes (Initial Phase):
   - In the current scope, we will eliminate folding schemes from the proof system, focusing solely on generating STARK-based proofs. This allows us to simplify the framework while building the foundation for future enhancements.
 - Scalability and Future Extensions (Long-term Vision):
   - Solidity-verifier generated by Sonobe library seems to be straightforward for being re-implemented in Cairo. So, we plan to implement the integration of Sonobe verifiers to Cairo. This will not only benefit VIMz to bring all of the proofs into the Starknet world, but also will help every folding-based protocol to be integrated to Cairo/Starknet for free.

## Benefits of STARKNET Integration:
 - Post-Quantum Security: STARKs are inherently secure against quantum attacks, ensuring VIMz remains robust in a post-quantum future.
 - Trustless C2PA-Compatible Marketplaces: By deploying on Starknet, VIMz enables the developer community on Starknet to build authentic marketplaces on-chain. This introduces a new set of  businesses possibilities in Starknet ecosystem.
 - Starknet Community: VIMz becomes available and introduced to a wider range of developers and VCs.
